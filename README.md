E2EE client encrypts files and sends them to [E2EE server](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server). For cryptography it uses [Crypton](https://github.com/SpiderOak/crypton). However, Crypton was [slightly modified](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-client/wiki/Speed-up-Javascript-crypto) to enable faster encryption/decryption of files.

# Usage

Files that are to be encrypted and stored on E2EE server can be dragged into E2EE client:

![drag file](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server/raw/master/pictures/drag.png)

Encrypted file is then listed in E2EE client: 

![encrypted file](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server/raw/master/pictures/file_encrypted.png)

Before the file is shared to another user, the trust has be established between the two users as shown below:

The file can be then shared to another user:

![sharing file](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server/raw/master/pictures/share1.png)

The user is now listed as being shared to:

![sharing file](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server/raw/master/pictures/share2.png)

The file is marked as being shared with a green icon:

![shared file](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server/raw/master/pictures/shared1.png)

The file is now available to the user to whom it was shared to - it is marked with a grey icon as shown:
