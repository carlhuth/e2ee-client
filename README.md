E2EE client encrypts files and sends them to [E2EE server](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server). For encryption/decryption it uses slightly modified [Crypton client](https://github.com/SpiderOak/crypton).

# Usage

Files that are to be encrypted and stored on E2EE server can be dragged into E2EE client:

Encrypted file is then listed in E2EE client:

Before the file is shared to another user, the trust has be established between the two users as shown below:
