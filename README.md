# End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) client

E2EE client encrypts files and sends them to [E2EE server](https://github.com/xlab-si/e2ee-server). It is essentially the same as [Crypton client](https://github.com/SpiderOak/crypton), but tied to a slightly different REST API of the E2EE server.

NOTE: E2EE client is a work in progress. It should never be used as a web page, but only through some sophisticated software installation system like the one provided for Chrome extensions.

## Installation

For testing purposes E2EE client can be run in the web directory (the path of the project needs to be set in web.py):

`python web.py`

After this the client can be accessed on: http://localhost:8000/
